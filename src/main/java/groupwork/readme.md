# Java code to refactor

Take the code in this package and refactor however you'd like. The only rules are

1. It must be written in Scala
1. It must compile and run

Other suggestions for your refactor are

1. Make it as stateless as possible
1. Use TDD to implement your rewrite
1. Use what you've learned of functional programming to your advantage

The code is taken from [Martin Fowler's refactoring](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP204/refactor/chap1.html).

Except for `Registrar`, that's my nonsense since it wasn't included.
