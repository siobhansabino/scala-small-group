# Scala small group

This repo is for the Scala small group I am leading internally at my company to allow others to see what I have. It is not meant to be Good or Proper. It should probably compile though. :fingerscrossed:

# Exercises

## Class problem

Write me classes to represent the following objects. You may do this in whatever way you like.

1. A graph is made of nodes and edges.
1. Nodes and edges have ids and maybe the date created (which can be stored as a string or an epoch, your choice).
1. Edges also have a source and target id.
1. Nodes might have properties which can be represented in a map with string keys and unknown value types.

## k-ary tree

Make me a usable representation of a [k-ary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree).
